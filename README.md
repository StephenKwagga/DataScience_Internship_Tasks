# 📊 DevelopersHub Data Science & Analytics Internship Tasks

Author: Stephen Kwagga  
Internship: Data Science & Analytics – DevelopersHub Corporation  


# 🗂 Overview

Welcome! This repository contains the complete deliverables for my *Data Science & Analytics Internship* at *DevelopersHub Corporation*.

It covers *five core tasks*, each carefully designed to add up and strengthen my skills in:

- 🔍 Data exploration & cleaning  
- 📊 Insightful visualizations (EDA)  
- 🧩 Practical machine learning modeling  
- 📈 Model evaluation with clear, business-ready insights  

Each task follows a strict, structured workflow — from raw data to final conclusions — all fully documented and reproducible.


# ✅ Included Tasks

- Task 1 – Exploring & Visualizing a Dataset  
  Load, summarize, and visualize the Iris dataset, using scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.

- Task 2 – Credit Risk Prediction 
  Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default using EDA, cleaning, and a classification model.

- Task 3 – Customer Churn Prediction  
  Identify bank customers likely to churn using *Logistic Regression, analyze the factors that influence churn, and evaluate predictions with a confusion matrix.

- Task 4 – Predicting Insurance Claims  
  Estimate medical insurance claim amounts based on personal data using linear regression.

- Task 5 – Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction 
  Predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer with EDA and classification modeling.

👉 Each task has its own folder and a dedicated README.md with:
- Problem description  
- Data explanation  
- Step-by-step modeling  
- Results & insights

# 🔑 My Approach

For every task, you’ll find:
- Introduction: Clear objectives.  
- Data Cleaning: Proper handling of missing values and outliers.  
- EDA: Well-explained visualizations to understand patterns and relationships.  
- Modeling: Clean, well-chosen models like 'Logistic Regression' (used for churn prediction), 'Decision Trees', and 'Linear Regression'.  
- Evaluation: Proper metrics — 'accuracy', 'confusion matrix', 'MAE', 'RMSE' — applied where relevant (e.g., confusion matrix for churn).  
- Conclusion: Key insights connected back to real business decisions.
