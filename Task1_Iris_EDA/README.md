# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset (Iris Dataset)

# Objective
Explore and visualize the Iris dataset to understand relationships between flower measurements and species.

# Dataset
- Source: Seaborn‚Äôs built-in Iris Dataset  
- Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width, species

# Approach
1. Data Summary
   - Loaded data using pandas, reviewed structure with .head(), .shape, .info().

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Histograms to show feature distributions.
   - Scatter plots for pairwise relationships.
   - Box plots grouped by species for outlier detection.

# üîç Key Insights
- Setosa species has smallest petals.
- Strong correlation between petal_length and petal_width.
- Clear separation between species based on features.
